Write a program that given an array of integers, will sort them ascending and then provide an ascending list of the primes in that list.

e.g.
Input:
	2,19,77,3,4,16,8,66,1,-333,0
Output:
	Input:
	{2,19,77,3,4,16,8,66,1,-333,0}
	
	Sorted(ASC):
	{-333,0,1,2,3,4,8,16,19,66,77}

	Primes - Sorted(ASC):
	{1,2,3,19}
